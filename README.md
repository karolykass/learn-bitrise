# learn-bitrise

This repository is a playground...  
;-)  

I'm interested in learning DevOps, CI/CD and automation technologies.  
After a few webinars, I decided to try out the Bitrise SaaS service. ([Bitrise's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpPg789a-SRZrcQ0GoH74KA/videos))  
  
There is a Hobby/Free plan. -> [Bitrise's Plans & pricing](https://www.bitrise.io/pricing)

Visual Studio Code Version: 1.45.1 Installed

#### Xcode 

Xcode Version 11.5 (11E608c) installed

### What I don't have?

#### Mobile development knowledge

I'm not a developer, I'm an engineer right now.  
I tried an iOS/Xcode hello-world example years ago.  
So I don't have mobile development knowledge too much. But I'm interested in CI/CD technologies... ;-)
